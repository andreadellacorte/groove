# Log Git

## Outcome

`<memory>/git/YYYY-MM-DD-GIT-N.md` is created with a git summary for the current session. N is auto-incremented based on existing files for that date.

## Acceptance Criteria

- File created at `<memory>/git/YYYY-MM-DD-GIT-N.md` with correct N
- Content includes commits since midnight, git status, and diff stats
- N does not collide with existing files for the same date
- File is suitable for inclusion in the same commit it describes

## Constraints

- Use `memory:` path from `.groove/index.md` frontmatter
- Always list existing files in `<memory>/git/` before writing to determine correct N
- N starts at 1 for the first file of the day, increments for subsequent
- Git data to include:
  - `git log --since=midnight --oneline` for commits
  - `git status --short` for current state
  - `git diff --stat HEAD` for changed files summary
- Use template at `templates/log/git.md` for file structure
- If no git changes since midnight, still write the file noting no changes
