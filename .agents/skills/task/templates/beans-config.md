# .beans.yml Template

Scaffold this file at the git root as `.beans.yml` when setting up beans backend for the first time.

```yaml
beans:
  path: .beans
  prefix: [PROJECT_PREFIX]-
  id_length: 4
  default_status: todo
  default_type: task
tui:
  exclude_archived: true
```

**Notes:**
- Replace `[PROJECT_PREFIX]` with a short uppercase abbreviation of the repo name (e.g. `GRV` for groove)
- `path` is where beans stores task files — `.beans` keeps them in repo root
- `id_length: 4` gives IDs like `GRV-0001`
- After creating this file, run `beans list` to verify beans is configured correctly
